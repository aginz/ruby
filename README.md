This is my playground for Ruby exercises.

1. Kaprekar proof: Ruby app that checks to see if number entered is a Kaprekar number.
For more info on Kaprekar numbers, check the wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprekar_number.
To run, type in terminal:
`ruby kaprekar-proof.rb`

2. MacBeth analyzer: Ruby exercise done for Upcase challenge. Parses through a XML document containing MacBeth play and counts the total number of lines for each speaker.
